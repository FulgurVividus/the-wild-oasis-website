# 1. Defining Routes and Pages

In NexJS in order to define a route, we need to create folder/file in the "app" folder, and by convention to name it "page.js".

Each Page in NextJS is simply a React component that we export from a "page.js" file which needs to be in some folder.

rootURL/cabins/cabin - the "cabin" is a page in the "cabins". 
So the nested folder structure is: app folder -> cabins folder (page.js) -> cabin folder (page.js)

# 2. Navigation between pages

<Link href=""></Link>
Is like <Link> in React Router but instead of 'to' we have 'href'.

So behind the scenes, what this does is to apply a few optimization techniques. 
-> So first of all, it will actually prefetch all the routes that are linked on a certain page, even though that only works in production. So we cannot see that happening here in development. 
-> What also happens is that each page is downloaded separately as a separate chunk, which will also improve performance again. 
-> And finally, each page that we visit in the browser will actually be cached right in the browser as well. So it will be stored there temporarily. And then as we move around, all these pages will not have to be refetched again.

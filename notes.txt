# 1. Defining Routes and Pages

In NexJS in order to define a route, we need to create folder/file in the "app" folder, and by convention to name it "page.js".

Each Page in NextJS is simply a React component that we export from a "page.js" file which needs to be in some folder.

rootURL/cabins/cabin - the "cabin" is a page in the "cabins". 
So the nested folder structure is: app folder -> cabins folder (page.js) -> cabin folder (page.js)
